"Love†is a mix of feelings and actions that shows a deep liking for someone or something. Romantic love can lead to things such as†dating,†marriage†and†sex, but a person can also feel for†friends, such as platonic love, or†family. There are also†chemical reactions†within the brain that can be triggered by the different types of love. Their are many kinds of love. There can be†self-love, love towards a friend (such as†platonic love), love in romance, towards†family, toward†God, or towards an object or idea. Often love can be confused with other feelings. Being†sexually†or†physically†attracted is the feeling of†lust. Lust and love may be thought of as different. Normal†friendship†is a form of love that can be distracted by lust and misunderstanding.","Sexual intercourse†(or simply called†sex) is the insertion and thrusting of a male's†penis†into a female's†vagina.[1][2]†People†and†animals†that†sexually reproduce†use sexual intercourse to have an†offspring. Sometimes sexual intercourse is called†coitus†or†copulation†and is more casually known as†having sex†or†sleeping together. The two animals may be of opposite†sexes†or they may be†hermaphroditic, as is the case with†snails.[3]†Sexual intercourse may also be between individuals of the†same sex.
Humans sometimes engage in behaviors that do not include the penetration of†sexual organs, such as†oral intercourse†or†anal intercourse†or by non-sexual organs (fingering,†fisting). These behaviors are sometimes included in the definition of sexual intercourse.[2]†Sex is usually teleiophilic (between adults).[4]

"The†tiger†(Panthera tigris) is the largest living member of the cat†family, the†Felidae. It feeds by hunting. It lives in†Asia, mainly†India,†Bhutan,†China,†Korea†and†Siberian†Russia.†Tigers are solitary animals. Tigers have orange†fur†with black stripes, and a white belly. The black stripes usually extend to the white underside. The stripes are used to keep them camouflaged while hunting. Usually, no two tigers have the same†pattern†of stripes.[5]
There are tigers with different colors. There are sometimes white tigers that have white fur with black stripes, or that even have pure white fur. They have orange or red eyes. Most Bengal tigers have orange fur. The white coat only appears once in every 100 births. The Bengal tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh and India.
","Cats, also called†domestic cats†(Felis catus), are small,†carnivorous†mammals, of the†family†Felidae.[3][4]
Domestic cats are often called 'house cats' when kept as indoor†pets.[5]†Cats have been†domesticated†(tamed) for nearly 10,000 years.[6]
They are one of the most popular†pets†in the world. They are kept by†humans†for hunting rodents and as†companions.
There are also†farm cats, which are kept on†farms†to keep†rodents†away; and†feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans.[7]
A cat is sometimes called a†kitty. A young cat is called a†kitten.[8]†A female cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a†queen. A male cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a†tom.
There are about 60 breeds of cat.[9]†Domestic cats are found in shorthair, longhair, and hairless breeds. Cats which are not specific breeds can be referred to as 'domestic shorthair' (DSH) or 'domestic longhair' (DLH).
The word 'cat' is also used for other†felines. Felines are usually called either†big cats†or†small cats. The big, wild cats are well known:†lions,†tigers,†leopards,†jaguars,†pumas, and†cheetahs. There are small, wild cats in most parts of the world, such as the†lynx†in northern†Europe. The big cats and wild cats are not tame, and can be very dangerous.

"A†book†is a set of†printed†sheets of†paper†held together between two covers. The sheets of paper are usually covered with a†text,†language†and†illustrations. The book is a more flexible format than the earlier idea of the†scroll. The change from scrolls to books began in the†Roman Empire, and took many centuries to become complete.
A writer of a book is called an†author. Someone who draws pictures in a book is called an†illustrator. Books can have more than one author or†illustrator.
A book can also be a†text†in a larger collection of texts. That way a†book†is perhaps written by one†author, or it only treats one subject area. Books in this sense can often be understood without knowing the whole collection. Examples are the†Iliad,†Odyssey,†Bible†and†Quran. All of them consist of a number of ÄúbooksÄù in this sense of the word.†Encyclopedias†often have separate articles written by different people, and published as separate†volumes. Each volume is a book.
Hardcover†books have hard covers made of†cardboard†covered in cloth or†leather†and are usually†sewn†together.†Paperback†books have covers of stiff paper and are usually†glued†together. The words in books can be read aloud and recorded on tapes or†compact discs. These are called ""audiobooks"".
Books can be borrowed from a†library†or bought from a†bookstore. People can make their own books and fill them with family photos, drawings, or their own writing. Some books are empty inside, like a†diary, address book, or†photo†album. Most of the time, the word ""book"" means that the pages inside have words printed or written on them.
","Modern†paper†is a thin†material†of (mostly)†wood fibres†pressed together. People write on paper with a†pencil†or†pen, and†books†are made of paper. Paper can absorb†liquids†such as†water, so people can clean things with paper. There are many types of paper.
The†pulp and paper industry†comprises companies that use wood as raw material and produce†pulp, paper, board and other cellulose-based products.
Modern paper is normally made from†wood†pulp.[1]†Wood is ground up and mixed with†water†and other†chemicals†to make a thin liquid called ""paper pulp"". Paper pulp can be†bleached†to make paper more white, and†dyes†can be added to make colored paper. This pulp is pressed into†sheets†of paper. Printing is often done on paper before the paper is cut into sheets. Newsprint paper (newspaper) comes in a huge roll, and goes through the printing process as one continuous sheet. It is cut by a machine-driven†guillotine†blade later. Folding comes last, then packing for distribution.

"A†computer keyboard†is an†input device†that allows a person to enter†letters,†numbers, and other†symbols†(together, these are called†characters) into a†computer. It is one of the most used input devices for computers. Using a keyboard is often called†typing.
A keyboard contains many†mechanical†switches†or†push-buttons†called ""keys"". When one of these are pushed, an†electrical circuit†is closed, and the keyboard sends a†signal†to the computer that tells it what letter, number or symbol it would like to be shown on the†screen. The computer then shows the character on the screen, usually at the place where the flashing text†cursor†is.
Besides entering characters, computer keyboards also have special keys that change the symbol (such as†shift†or†caps lock) or give the computer special commands (such as the†arrow keys,†CTRL†and†ALT). Different computer†operating systems use different special keys, or use them differently. Special commands can also be glizzie! activated through combinations of keys, called keyboard shortcuts. Some of the most common shortcuts on Windows programs are: Ctrl + C, to copy some text or a picture; Ctrl + V, to paste what was copied; and Ctrl + F, to find a certain word on a document or web page.
","A†computer†is a†machine†that uses†electronics†to input, process, store, and output†data. Data is information such as numbers, words, and lists. Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a†hard drive, or a†sensor. The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in†software†programs. A computer program is a list of instructions the computer has to perform. Programs usually perform mathematical calculations, modify data, or move it around. The data is then saved in a storage device, shown on a†display, or sent to another computer. Computers can be connected together to form a†network†such as the†internet, allowing the†computers†to communicate with each other.
The†processor†of a computer is made from†integrated circuits†(chips) that contains many†transistors. Most computers are†digital, which means that they represent information by using†binary†digits, or†bits. Computers come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the brand and model and purpose. They range from small computers such as smartphones and†laptops, to large computers such as†supercomputers.

"A†fixed-wing aircraft†is a kind of†aircraft. An aircraft is a†machine†that can†fly, but is heavier than†air. Fixed-wing aircraft are sometimes called airplanes, aeroplanes or sometimes just ""planes"". All fixed-wing aircraft have†wings†that use†forward airspeed†to generate†lift.[1]†Gliders†are fixed-wing aircraft that do not have†engines.[2] A steam-powered unmanned fixed-wing aircraft, that weighed 9†lb (4.1†kg),[3]†was built by†John Stringfellow, in†Chard,†Somerset,†England†in 1848. It could fly by itself without needing to be dropped from high up. There were†gliders†before this, but they had to fly by being pushed off a building or hill.
The first man who flew (took off, steered, and landed) a motor-powered aircraft was†Orville Wright†in 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,†USA.[4]
","An†automobile†(or†car) is a land vehicle used to carry†passengers. Automobiles usually have four†wheels†(round things which turn in order to lead to movement), and an†engine†or†motor†to make them move. The word ""automobile"" comes from the†Greek†prefix†""Œ±œÖœÑœå"" (self) and the†Latin†word ""mobilis"" (moving). This name means ""self-moving"", as cars run on their own†power†and do not need†horses†or other power from outside to move.",5.77
"A†train†is a set of cars on a†railway. The vehicles that carry freight or are called†cars†(in the United States) or†wagons†(in the United Kingdom). The ones that carry passengers are often called coaches or carriages. A place where a train stops to let people get on and off is called a†train station†or†railway station. Early trains used†horse†power and ran on wooden or iron tracks. These were used in the†Middle Ages. The first steam trains were built in†England†in the early 19th century. Long before railways, ""train"" meant any group of vehicles or pack animals traveling in a line, as in†wagon train†or camel train.
Trains contain the†prime mover†(either locomotive or motor unit) and one or more cars. The†locomotive†or railway engine (usually the first car of the train) pulls the cars along the track. The last car you will see on a train is called the caboose. Some trains look like a special†bus†that can only drive on rails. Trains are used to carry people, as well as cargo, such as†raw material,finished goods, and†waste.

"Telegram†television†(also known as a†TV) is a†machine†with a†screen. Televisions receive†broadcasting†signals†and change them into†pictures†and†sound. The word ""television"" comes from the words†tele†(Greek†for†far away) and†vision†(sight).
Sometimes a television can look like a†box. Older TVs had a large†cathode ray tube†in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like†furniture. Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.
A TV can show pictures from many†television networks.†Computers†and†mobile devices†also can be used for watching†television programs.
The television was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread.
At first, all televisions used an†antenna†(or aerial). This would pick up†television programmes†from†broadcasting†stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from†VCD†and†DVD†players or†VCRs.†Cable TV†and†Satellite television†can provide more programs at once than broadcast can.†Video game consoles†connect to most modern TVs. Some†computers†can also use a TV as a†computer monitor.
","Radio†is a way to send†electromagnetic signals†over a long distance, to deliver†information†from one place to another. A machine that sends radio signals is called a†transmitter, while a machine that ""picks up"" the signals is called a†receiver†or antenna. A machine that does both jobs is a ""transceiver"". When†radio signals†are sent out to many receivers at the same time, it is called a†broadcast.
Television†also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound. Radio†signals can start engines moving so that gates open on their own from a distance. (See:†Radio control.). Radio signals can be used to lock and unlock the doors in a car from a distance.
