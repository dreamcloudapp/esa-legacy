I was at my parents' house and my parents were telling me about how their dog Luna was starting to speak with Wesley.
The language was not complex or expressive, but she could convey simple ideas. 
Everyone had been in the car together when Luna had said something to Wesley about how Carleigh was the child of a dog and not a human.
The phrase that she used sounded like "Worchester Child".
I tried to convince my parents that she might not really be speaking but that they were finding meaning in her normally expressive whining and yelping.
I told them about 5 or 6 randomized, double blind, placebo studies where they had been able to get people to hear words in meaningless sounds by giving them auditory cues.
My dad wasn't convinced but did see the strength in the studies.
