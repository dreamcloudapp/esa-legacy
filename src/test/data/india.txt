I was in India, exploring the town that Haseeb and his parents lived in.
I walked through several city squares, going into each shop.
All of the shops that I can remember were coffee shops and diners.
I didn't buy anything because I didn't know the language and couldn't read the menus or speak to the staff.
I walked around a few corners until I was worried that if I went further I wouldn't be able to find my way back to Haseeb's parents' house where I was staying.
I returned to their house, where Haseeb's mother had prepared a lovely meal: seasoned fish.
It tasted good, though it had a lot of small bones.
Haseeb's father didn't finish his because of the bones, but I didn't mind.
His fish may have been prepared differently causing it to have more bones.
I finished my meal and went outside again to walk my dog which I had brought with me.
The dog was very poorly behaved.
It knew basic commands and I made it sit and settle, but it was very bad about pulling at the leash.
A few people approached wanting to pet the dog, and I told them about how terrible the dog was.
Later I met up with Haseeb and we hung out for a while as he showed me the sites.
