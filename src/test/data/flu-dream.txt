Last night I had a dream of being sick.
It started with the weird sensation in my arms, some sort of tremor, I think.
Then I began to feel nauseous.
My arms and legs were heavy, and I felt like I was about to pass out.
Then I remember thinking about illness, and the fear of being bedridden for the rest of my life was overwhelming.
