I dreamed I was levitating just a few centimeters above the ground.
I was at some social gathering, and I got embarrassed that people might notice my levitation and get jealous or scared.
I wanted to hide my ability by pretending as if nothing happened.
I knew that others couldn't fly, so I tried to be mindful of that.
But secretly, I just wanted to get away from the crowd and fly above the city.
Then dreams suddenly changed, and I was on a mission to fly to Venus.
I remember being worried about surviving without oxygen.
