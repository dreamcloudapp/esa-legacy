I'm sitting in the dining room with my family.
Luna sits next to the table sprawled out.
My mom throws a ball for the dog, and we hear the sound of the ball being caught.
Since Luna hadn't moved, my mom thought that it must have been Carleigh in the other room who had caught the ball.
I however pointed out that it couldn't have been because Carleigh was dead.
I explained the the sound my mom heard must have been the ball hitting the metal grating in front of the fireplace.
I went to the living room where the ball was thrown and found Carleigh lying there with the ball.
But only I could see her and I still knew that she was dead and was only there for me.
We came back to the dining room and my mom wondered why I was acting as if I was petting something on the ground.
I told her that I was petting Carleigh but that made my mom sad because she also knew that Carleigh was dead.
