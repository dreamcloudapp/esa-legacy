"I was on a trail in Massachusetts hunting dinosaurs. I was tracking one of them, which had left large footprints in the wet ground along a river. As I got closer, I realized that I didn't have a weapon. Some men appeared and helped me to fashion a weapon using stone tools. Before I left, they gave me a map which showed me where the dinosaur was. I came to a fence with a no trespassing sign, and I wasn't sure if I should continue. I heard gunshots up ahead and decided that I would have to risk it. I ran across the field to a clearing and saw police officers firing at the dinosaur. It was a triceratops and didn't look very threatening. By the time I got closer, it had fallen to the ground, and when I approached it, it decayed in front of me and went through the entire process of becoming a fossil before my eyes. The fossil was mostly buried and I began digging it up, but the police officers came over and arrested me.","Authorities in Massachusetts have arrested two men they allege were digging in an area of protected fossilized dinosaur footprints. Police say the men from New Jersey and Connecticut were seen by police on Saturday afternoon walking up the stairs at the site along the Connecticut River in Holyoke carrying out rocks and tools.

The men were charged with vandalism, trespassing and an archeological violation. They were released on personal recognizance. It was not clear if they had attorneys.",7.5
"I was in my house, but it was dark as the power was out. I walked downstairs to find out what had happened, but when I got to the bottom step, I saw that the house was flooded and filled with about a foot of water. I was worried about one of my clients trying to come over and being drowned, and I tried to run to find my phone, but I was having difficulty moving through the water. I eventually found it and dialed my client, but it went to their answering machine, I couldn't get a hold of them. I looked outside and saw a car being swept away in waves being driven by a strong wind, and I wondered if it was them.","Small businesses are struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, facing days or weeks without power and Internet, storm damage and difficulty communicating with clients or customers.

"I was hanging out with some friends at a party, when everyone started doing drugs. One guy was popping benzos like they were candy, and another was injecting heroin. I was afraid of being caught with these guys as I was sure the police would only try to get me. One of the guys doing heroin wasn't feeling well, and when I looked at him, I could tell he had stopped breathing. Someone called 911 and the police arrived, but the guy died. The police let everyone else go, but they cornered me as I tried to escape and arrested me. The scene changes, and I'm in court and being accused of murder.

"I had traveled to India to visit my friend Haseeb, but when I got there I had to attend a school to learn the language before I could enter the rest of the country. We had to wear masks to class, and when I arrived at my class, I couldn't find mine. I didn't want to miss the class because it would mean that I couldn't see my friend and would have to leave. But then another student told me that I didn't need to wear a mask because I had already caught COVID.

"I'm in a courtroom as part of a grand jury, I'm listening intently to the prosecution present their case.  3 police officers are standing in the dock, they are charged with the manslaughter of an innocent black man by the name of John Baptiste.

The most elaborate rover ever sent to the red planet will attempt to land on Thursday (February 18).

'Mars guru' Robert Zubrin, president of advocacy group, the Mars Society, believes crewed missions may not be far behind, as private firms like Elon Musk's SpaceX accelerate human spaceflight.

STORY-LINE:

NASA scientists are hoping their six-wheeled Perseverance rover will touch down safely on Thursday (February 18).

It's the most difficult Martian touchdown yet - the spot is filled with cliffs, pits and fields of rocks, any of which could doom the $3 billion mission.

Successful or not, 'Mars guru' Robert Zubrin, president of advocacy group, the Mars Society, believes crewed missions may not be far behind, perhaps within a decade.

""Once this thing becomes an imminent possibility, then it's going to get real serious real fast,"" he says.

NASA is currently concentrating on its Artemis moon-landing program, which is aiming to land the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024, although the chances of that happening are growing increasingly slim.

Zubrin believes the key will be private companies, particularly Elon Musk's SpaceX and its futuristic, bullet-shaped Starship.

Musk is developing Starship to carry people to Mars, perhaps in as little as several years. SpaceX's second full Starship test flight earlier this month ended in another fiery crash landing.

""So, Starship's are going to be flying regularly to orbit with very large payloads by 2024,"" says Zubrin.

""And okay, we're going to have an election in 2024, probably have a new president. Whoever's elected, with Starships flying to orbit is going to ask his or her advisers, look at this, this guy wants to go to Mars. Could we have people on Mars by the end of my second term? Answer, yes, sure.""

In the shorter term, Zubrin believes Perseverance's four-pound (1.8-kilogram) hitchhiking helicopter, Ingenuity, could be a game-changer for Mars exploration.

The future could see next-generation helicopters scouting out distant Martian territory for astronauts or even robots.

""If this thing works, our capability to explore Mars is going to expand by orders of magnitude, both with purely robotic and combined human robotic exploration,"" Zubrin says.

And NASA's Mars rovers and lander may not be alone for long.

China hopes to become the second nation to pull off a successful Martian landing in late spring with its own life-seeking rover, its vessel entered orbit around Mars last week.

China's secretive, military-linked space program has racked up a series of achievements. In December, it brought moon rocks back to Earth for the first time since the 1970s. China was also the first country to land a spacecraft on the little-explored far side of the moon in 2019.

Most contacts with NASA are blocked by U.S. Congress and China is not a participant in the International Space Station.

Zubrin believes we are entering a new space race, but it will ""serve to ameliorate the potential for conflict"".

""I don't think we're going to go to Mars together with the Chinese in the same ship, like on the space station where we supply that system and they supply the other system, no,"" he says.

""But maybe we can go together each in our own ship and, you know, have agreements to help each other out if we get into trouble, and compete for honors as to who will make the greatest discoveries, you know. That's the kind of atmosphere we can have.""

At least 50,413 people had died, as of late May, with Covid-19 listed on their death certificate, according to England and Wales' Office for National Statistics (ONS), the National Records of Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.
The ONS said 45,748 had died with the virus in England and Wales as of May 29.
A further 3,911 died in Scotland as of May 31, and 754 passed away with the virus in Northern Ireland as of May 29.
The UK has the second highest number of coronavirus deaths globally. Its death toll is surpassed only by the US, which has recorded more than 111,000 fatalities.
This latest data differs from the British government's official count. The UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has reported only 40,680 coronavirus fatalities, which is the number included in the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 Dashboard.
The discrepancy between the two death tolls is caused by different counting methods. The DHSC only records deaths where the deceased was previously diagnosed with coronavirus, as opposed to the disease being detected post-mortem.
The UK has officially recorded 288,834 cases of coronavirus, the highest case total in Europe.",4.666666667
"I was dreaming about the schoolyard, where I used to play when I was a child. As I was walking by, I noticed a sign that told me the place was under construction and that it has now turned into an archeological site. I looked closer and realized that there is some kind of excavation in progress. It was evident that they had to dig up almost the entire schoolyard, so I asked one of the workers what they were looking for. “I have no idea”, he replied, so I moved closer to the site to look for myself. As I approached the excavated schoolyard, I saw a stone entranceway to the underground area. I took the stairs, also made of stone, and descended into the giant hall located under the yard. Soon I discovered, that the hall was actually an ancient library. There were numerous shelves, carved into stone. The library was enormous and abandoned. When it was operational (ancient, probably), it must have had shelf space for billions of books. All the books were long gone, but the shelves were still there, as well as many corridors. As I passed through one of them, I realized I could easily get lost if I don’t orientate myself. Luckily, the sun was just about to set and the light was shining straight to the entrance. The sunlight was my source of orientation and I thought to myself: I’d better be exploring this library during the day, otherwise I might get lost and will never find my way out. I felt gratitude and deep respect for that place. I also knew that I discovered a sacred and intact sanctuary, where the energies of the old wisdom still reside","Philadelphia is banning indoor gatherings of any size, public or private, as the city battles a resurgence of the coronavirus, officials announced Monday, warning that hospitals will become overrun by the end of the year without dramatic action.

The city also plans to ban indoor dining at restaurants, shutter casinos, gyms, museums and libraries, prohibit in-person instruction at colleges and high schools, and reduce occupancy at stores and religious institutions, the health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, said at a news conference Monday.

The new restrictions take effect Friday and extend at least through the end of the year.

The blanket prohibition on indoor gatherings of any kind — everything from holiday parties and football gatherings to baby showers and brunches — will not be enforced, city officials acknowledged. Farley said the city is seeking voluntary compliance, saying the virus is rampant and ""spreading a little bit everywhere,"" including at small social gatherings.

City officials said dramatic action is needed to respond to an exponential growth in cases and hospitalizations. The rate of new confirmed infections is growing about 4% each day, Farley said.

He said the outbreak is ""approaching its worst,"" and the weeks ahead are ""a little grim if we don't take strong action.""

Pennsylvania has shattered daily case records recently. The state is reporting an average of 4,900 new infections per day, up nearly 120% in two weeks, according to AP analysis of data from The COVID Tracking Project. The daily death toll has nearly doubled in that period, to about 42 per day, though it remains far below what it was last spring. Hospitalizations and the percentage of virus tests are also up sharply.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has imposed a statewide mask mandate, occupancy restrictions at bars and restaurants and limits on indoor and outdoor gatherings, but has not moved to reimpose broader restrictions seen earlier in the pandemic.

The Philadelphia school district had planned to start returning K-12 students to the classroom, but said last week that schools will remain virtual for the foreseeable future in light of the explosion in cases.",2.25

Scientists insist that the ice on top of Mt. Kilimanjaro is melting, but nobody really knows why.

Although the mountain itself lies within Tanzania's borders, it looms large on the horizon of Kenya's Amboseli National Park, which lies immediately North West of Mt. Kilimanjaro.

The United Nations Environment Programme says the world's ice and snow is shrinking - and it's mainly due to global warming.

15 percent of the earth is covered by ice and snow, glaciers, permafrost and frozen lakes.

It all plays a critical role in regulating the world's weather, sea level and ocean currents, in ecosystems and wildlife habitats and as a vast store of fresh water.

In the Northern hemisphere, snow cover has been shrinking at an average of 1.3 percent per decade over the last 40 years.

Along with melting glaciers, the reduction in snow cover could have a serious impact on water resources. Snow in mountain regions contributes to water supplies for almost one-sixth of the world's population.

According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 82 per cent of the ice cap on top of Mount Kilimanjaro has been lost since 1912.

AAAS's researchers shows that in 1912 there were about 4.3 square miles of ice fields atop the mountain.

By 2000, the fields had shrunk to 0.94 square miles.

The AAAS's scientists predict that at the current rate of decrease, the entire glacier will disappear sometime before 2020 if the current trends in global warming continue.

Much of the snow which is melting is travelling under ground, not into the rivers in the region.

If the trends continue as they have, locals people who live in the park are worried that the animals will flee or die leaving them to fend for themselves.

The region is one of Kenya's top tourist destinations, bringing much needed money for the people who not only depend on tourism, but for thousands of Maasai cattle herders who depend on their live stock for their survival.

Ahead of 'World Environment Day' on June 5, Nick Knuttal of the United Nations Environment Programme says this year's theme is melting ice.

From Kilimanjaro to melting ice packs in the Arctic, UNEP wants to draw attention to the impact that climate change is having on some of the world's most vulnerable regions with the new report.

The polar ice sheets hold about 99 percent of the world's freshwater ice.

The report says that the annual shrinking of the Greenland Ice Sheet doubled in the 1990s and may have doubled again by 2005.

Melting ice sheets are having global repercussions - by raising sea levels and endangering hundreds of millions of people living on coasts and small islands.

Melting of sea ice at current rates could lead to the Arctic Ocean being ice-free in summer, by 2100 or earlier.

"I enter a place It is a place where Dad used to work (AVCO), or that has been taken over by a company that still has as one component the place where Dad used to work (AVCO). There is a man here who used to know my Dad or work with my Dad, or at least who understands, intuitively, my need to know as much as possible about my Dad and retain as much as possible of items that were important to my dad. We enter a room. It is a room that is normally kept locked, but this man has the key (he has access). When we enter the room, I see on the floor some papers that my Dad left here many years ago, during the 1970s when he was going through his crisis. The papers are various kinds of documents and charts that have information and equations pertaining to the size, intensity, power, and destructive capability of a nuclear bomb or of a type of nuclear bomb. One part of the documents are existing things about this, i.e., things that someone else wrote, and the other part of the documents is what my Dad commented about that, like, he wrote his own calculations and comments onto the documents. From his commentsboth the content, and the quality/manner in which they are writtenit is clear that my father had become aware that the nuclear arsenal or nuclear bombs that AVCO was making or had made contained enormous destructive capability, an amount that was staggering to any person who has the capability of truly becoming aware and responding. It's like the person who typed the preexisting document with the various equations showing the power of the nuclear bomb(s)/arsenal did so in a calculated, cold, automatic kind of way, without really thinking about (allowing himself to think about) what he was writing and the implications of what he was writing (like a technocrat or just doing his job, basically), and my father came along and saw these documents, read these documents, and had an authentic emotional response to what he discerned, and an authentic moral responsewhich included components of feeling horror, anguish, sorrow, desperation, urgency, alarm, shock/astonishment, overwhelm, awareness, and possibly other emotions. he had written his calculations and comments by hand, in various places in the documents, and from seeing thishis writingsthe content and mannerI can sense his emotional responses to what he was discerning(and the inner life he had, the aliveness that characterized his inner life.). there are also some small sketches of something that look like blackish-grey (charcoal) smoke, which are meant to represent something about the aftermath of a nuclear explosion or the impact of a nuclear explosion. (the way these smudges look reminds me of the kinds of smudges that are used in some type of watercolor paintings from Asia or possibly from China in particular or that part of Asia) something about the smudges also reminds me a little of ancient Chinese poetry and ancient Chinese calligraphy. But it has to do with my father's increasing awareness of the realities of the implications of nuclear weapons and nuclear war, the weapons that heand AVCOwas/were working on. Unlike the others around him, who are like technocrats or almost like automatons, unthinking, unfeeling, automatically going through the motions without awareness, he is a man who has a natural feelingness and responsiveness to what he sees going on around him, as well as a capacity to notice (become aware of) what he sees going on around him. awake, alive, responsive the man who brought me here, to this room, seems to intuitively understand that I would want to have some time alone in this room, so he's left the room and allowed me to stay in here for some minutes by myself. I am aware that after I leave this room I might never have an opportunity to come back and find these items associated with my Dad here again in this way there might be no-one to unlock the door for me, or someone might have taken the items away and discarded them. I have the desire to pick up these items (documents) and take them with me (keep them), but I am afraid that the man who brought me here and also others at AVCO will think that I am trying to steal nuclear secrets if I scoop up the items and take them with me (keep them). I'm afraid that I'll be accused of trying to steal nuclear secrets when in fact I mostly want these materials because they were an important part of my father's life and an important part of my father's inner life and they contain his handwriting. And I really do want every last scrap of material or handwriting that reminds me of my Dad or connects me to my Dad. So I am struggling with the tension/pull between my desire to scoop up these documents and keep them, and my fear that if I do so I will be falsely accused of doing so to obtain nuclear secrets, rather than to deepen my connection with and understanding of my father, and also the tension/pressure caused by my awareness that there is time urgencythat when the man comes back to the room to escort me out, or when I go out, if I don't have these materials with me at that time then it is unlikely I will ever be able to get them again (or even see them again) I am aware that they would probably be taken away and discarded, or that even if they are left here I'd be unlikely to have access again like I do now. So I am holding (being with) that tension and sense of urgency and sense of being pulled in different directions. Meanwhile, I am here, in this room, a room which had been kept locked for many years and which had been untouched for many years, the papers are on the floor, I feel connected to my Dad through these materials, and I feel an increasing awareness and understanding of what he was grappling with and what he understood, and of the impact this understanding and growing awareness had on him, and of the burdens of being an alive, aware, responsive person. I sense the life inside him, the intellectual and emotional responsiveness. he lived. I am not sure whether the man comes back and I interact with him further or not. And I am not sure whether I scoop the items up and try to take them with me or whether I leave them as they are and just try to remember them For now here I am in this room, beholding the documents on the floor, holding the tension, with a growing awareness, with a quality of gradually growing awareness, with a quality of gradually deepening awareness, (just as my father had), I have a quality of gradually deeper awareness of my father's gradually deepening awareness (insight into his insight), maturity, wisdom, insight.","The US administration believes a threat to attack the nuclear power station, Three Mile Island, on July 4th is credible, and it is stepping up security at all US nuclear sites.

A government source says officials last week received information that terrorists plan to strike a US nuclear plant on the national holiday.

The source says early findings indicate the information isn't credible enough to act upon - but the government is still taking it seriously. According to the information, Islamic militants are planning to attack the Three Mile Island nuclear site in Pennsylvania or another nuclear plant elsewhere in the Northeast. The story was first reported in the Washington Times.

The source says the threat is one of many filtering through US intelligence, and doesn't warrant any kind of formal warning to the public.

But in Washington, Massachusetts Congressman, Ed Markey, told reporters that he has written to the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission asking for measures to be taken to protect the plants in case the threat is credible.",5.625
"Some little creature with a big curved mouth and lots of little sharp teeth grabs my hands and bites down on my fingers....it hurts, and I try to prevent the creature from biting down harder and possibly biting off my fingers....I finally get my hands out of its mouth and the creatures scampers away outside into the bushes....I look through a glass door in the direction where it went....I say to a woman I'm with, do you have a shotgun?....It's only partly a joke, as I feel angry at the creature for hurting me....At another point I'm struggling with a guy in a room....he goes down on the floor, and I start to leave the room but he throws a knife at me....It's like I'm watching myself at this point, and I see the knife hit right below the chin....did it hit my neck?....no, it just missed and hit the door jamb....I toss the knife back to him and hurry out the door before he can throw it again....","The U.S. vaccination drive against COVID-19 stood on the verge of a major new phase as government advisers Thursday recommended booster doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans — despite doubts the extra shots will do much to slow the pandemic.

Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said boosters should be offered to people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 to 64 who have risky underlying health problems. The extra dose would be given once they are at least six months past their last Pfizer shot.

Deciding who else might get one was far tougher. While there is little evidence that younger people are in danger of waning immunity, the panel offered the option of a booster for those ages 18 to 49 who have chronic health problems and want one.

The advisers refused to go further and open boosters to otherwise healthy front-line health care workers who aren’t at risk of severe illness but want to avoid even a mild infection.",1.75
"Last night I had one of my typical school dreams. I was back at the media building at my high school, and I was going to some English class. And I knew that there would be a fire drill scheduled in the afternoon when I was in that class, but I had some homework that I really needed to turn in, so I went to this elevator. It was this really rickety elevator that wobbled and wobbled as you went up. And I was really scared in that elevator. But I got up to the class and took out and handed in my stuff and there was a substitute teacher and I just told her I'm visually impaired, and this is my ? schedule. And I need to already be outside so that I don't get lost in the shuffle. But it was close to the time change and my clock hadn't been changed an hour later, so I kept having to adjust in my mind and I was like doubting myself. And then I finally grabbed my books and ran down the stairs a few minutes before it was supposed to be 2:30. And I think I just went up to the lawn in the front of the school and sat down, and then I woke up.","A German university resumed testing its students at its campus as part of a pilot project on Monday.

The Technical University of Dortmund began its testing pilot project in March, with students and staff using PCR tests, taking an A and a B sample themselves using the ""lollipop method"".

The tests are pooled for analysis, combining test samples in batches instead of running them one by one.

Matthias Schneider, a professor of medical physics at the university, helped develop the pilot testing strategy, which is voluntary.

He is also is a member of the No-COVID initiative, a group of sci­en­tists aiming to develop a strategy to contain COVID-19 through so-called 'intelligent testing', following examples used in Australia.

University president Prof. Dr. Manfred Bayer, said while most lectures and seminars remain online, the tests would enable some students and employees to be present on campus for teaching, research and administration purposes.

One of the students, Hannes Wegener, said the tests made him feel comfortable to return to the campus for lab work on his chemistry course.",3.25
"I was taking a trip to Hawaii -- but it was all very rushed and sudden. I could see the plane waiting on the runway and I was in my room thinking I needed something to read for the trip. As I was getting closer to the plane (its colors were brown and red) I saw Barack, who was going there, too. I thought that I should have brought a swimsuit.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Fossilized footprints discovered in New Mexico indicate that early humans were walking across North America around 23,000 years ago, researchers reported Thursday.

The footprints were found in a dry lake bed in White Sands National Park, first spotted in 2009 by a park manager. Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey recently analyzed seeds stuck in the footprints to determine their approximate age, ranging from around 22,800 and 21,130 years ago,

Most scientists believe ancient migration came by way of a now-submerged land bridge that connected Asia to Alaska. Based on various evidence — including stone tools, fossil bones and genetic analysis — other researchers have offered a range of possible dates for human arrival in the Americas, from 13,000 to 26,000 years ago or more.

The current study provides a more solid baseline for when humans definitely were in North America, although they could have arrived even earlier, the authors say. Fossil footprints are more indisputable and direct evidence than “cultural artifacts, modified bones, or other more conventional fossils,” they wrote.",1
"I dreamed that my grandmother had a birthday, we went to Corozal, there was a big party and we played Mexican cumbias. The red baloons and blue confetti were everywhere. And we were almost all getting ready to return to Santiago.","A gunman attacked a grocery store in an upscale Tennessee suburb on Thursday afternoon, killing one person and wounding 12 others before the suspect was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at the store, authorities said.

Collierville Police Chief Dale Lane said the shooting broke out at a Kroger grocery in his suburban community about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Memphis. He said the gunman shot 13 others and himself, and that 12 of the victims were taken to hospitals, some with very serious injuries.

One Kroger worker, Brignetta Dickerson, told WREG-TV she was working a cash register when she heard what at first she thought were balloons popping.

“And, here he comes right behind us and started shooting,” Dickerson said. “And, he kept on shooting, shooting, shooting. He shot one of my co-workers in the head and shot one of my customers in the stomach.”",0.5
